# About graph.txt file
### File represents a graph  
### Graph's vertexes are named after capital letters, starting from A, then B, etc.  
### First line of file inludes number of vertexes.  
### Other lines represent vertexes. In those lines:  
-First number is the number of edges coming from the vertex  
-Next, there are pairs of vertex, where the edge enters and the weight of the edge.  
-First line is a source, the last one is an snik.
